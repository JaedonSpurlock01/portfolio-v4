# Introduction
Hey guys, thanks for checking out this portfolio.

# Inspiration
I looked at tons of other portfolio websites and wanted to make my own!

# What custom
For the code theme, I am using the <>Lambda Studio â€” Blackout</> VSCode theme. Check it out here!

```typescript
export default function hello() {
  return (
    <div className="mt-10 text-lg font-bold">
      <p>Hello World</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
